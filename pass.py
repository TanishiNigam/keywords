#Write a program to satisfy the following conditions of the given range: If the number is divisible by 20, it provides an output "twist."
# If the number is divisible by 15, it will pass (no output) 
# If the number is divisible by 5, it will give an output “fizz.” 
# If the number is divisible by 3 it will give an output "buzz." Otherwise, it will give the output of that number.
